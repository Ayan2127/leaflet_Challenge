# leaflet_Challenge


I created a Leaflet visualization for the United States Geological Survey (USGS), involving geoJSON data. This visualization displays earthquakes from the past 7 days, utilizing the most up-to-date data. Each bubble map depicts an earthquake, with the circle's color representing the depth of the earthquake, and the circle's size reflecting its magnitude. Larger circle markers indicate higher magnitudes, while red circle markers indicate greater depth levels. The map includes a legend that illustrates depth ranges and their corresponding colors. When a circle marker is selected, a popup appears displaying detailed information about the earthquake, including its location, magnitude, and depth.
